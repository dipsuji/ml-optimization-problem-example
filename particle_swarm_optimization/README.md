# Objective is to research and know about particle swarms optimization solutions for minimazions problems with different differnt libraries to check accuracy and speed.

## MOPSO.ipynb
- This is the way of solving minimization probem with genetic algorithm using Pyswarms library.

## PSO_with_Pyswarms.ipynb
- This is the way of solving sphere funtions with particle swarm optimization using Pyswarms library.
